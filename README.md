##  Jenkinsfile Explained

This Jenkinsfile defines a multi-stage pipeline for setting up and testing an Apache web server on a system using the `apt` package manager. Here's a breakdown of each stage:

**1. Update:**
- This stage updates the package lists on the system using the `sudo apt-get update` command. This ensures that the system has access to the latest package information before installing software.

**2. Install:**
- This stage installs the Apache web server using the `sudo apt-get install apache2 -y` command. The `-y` flag allows the installation to proceed without confirmation prompts.

**3. Test:**
- This stage verifies if the Apache web server is running properly using the `service apache2 status` command. This command displays the current status of the Apache service and helps ensure it's functional before further steps.

**4. Running script:**
- This stage executes a bash script named `check-codes-apachelog`. Before running the script, it changes the permissions using `chmod +x check-codes-apachelog` to make it executable. This script is likely designed to scan the Apache error log for specific error codes (4xx and 5xx) and potentially take actions based on the findings.

**Note:**

This snippet assumes the script `check-codes-apachelog` is already present in the same location as the Jenkinsfile. You'll need to provide the script and adjust the path if it's located elsewhere. Additionally, ensure the script has proper permissions and functionalities for error checking as intended.
